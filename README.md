# Java-Tools

**Custom Java Tools Development**  

Developed **custom Java tools** that replicate the functionality of inbuilt Java classes, such as **Scanner**, **List Interface** **ArrayList**, and **LinkedList**, providing tailored implementations for specific use cases. These tools demonstrate a deep understanding of Javaâ€™s core concepts and the ability to design efficient, reusable, and extensible solutions.  

### **Key Highlights**  
1. **Custom Implementations of Core Java Classes**  
   - **Scanner:** Built a custom implementation to handle input parsing, offering functionality similar to the inbuilt `Scanner` class, tailored to specific project requirements.  
   - **List Interface ArrayList and LinkedList:** Designed custom versions of these data structures with efficient methods for adding, removing, and retrieving elements, demonstrating expertise in algorithm design and memory management named as TMList interface, TMLinkedlit, TMArraylist.  

2. **Setter-Getter Generator Tool**  
   - Created a **Java Setter-Getter Generator**, an innovative tool designed for **large-scale applications**.  
   - Automates the generation of **setter and getter methods** and **constructors**, significantly reducing development time for applications with extensive data models.  
   - Enhances developer productivity by eliminating repetitive coding tasks, ensuring consistency and accuracy across complex applications.  

### **Technical Skills Demonstrated**  
- Proficiency in **object-oriented programming** concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.  
- Strong knowledge of **data structure design** and efficient algorithm implementation.  
- Expertise in automating repetitive tasks, improving development workflows, and boosting overall efficiency.
